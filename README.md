# Prime number finder

Simple project to see now many prime numbers can be found using a low-powered machine. The target machine is a [Ramnode OpenVZ SSD with 128MB physical RAM and 64MB swap](http://www.ramnode.com/vps.php).

The attempt envisages that the target machine will crash due to memory issues, so the script is written to write prime numbers to a file, so that it can easily be restarted.

## Set-up
